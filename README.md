Eat-Da-Burger App

Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app where users can track what burgers they'd like to eat, and which they have already "devoured". 

They can enter any kind of burger they wish in the "Add a Burger" section. When they click the button to submit, it is added to the MySQL database, and displayed on the left side of the screen. Each burger listed there has a "Devour!" button. If pushed, this button marks that burger as "Devoured" in the database, removes it from the left column, and puts that burger in a column on the right of the screen.

The Eat-Da-Burger App is deployed on Heroku here: https://pure-dusk-15404.herokuapp.com/ 

Technologies: Express, Node.js, Handlebars.js, MySQL, jQuery, Bootstrap
